### Outline

**Topic**: What Russia's Invasion of Ukraine Tells the World about the Nature and Consequences of Modern Conflict

**Introduction Narrative**: Since the end of the Cold War, the world has witnessed states gradually losing control of their monopoly on violence. The war in Ukraine gives national security practitioners and humanitarion advocates an opportunity to evaluate the changing nature of conflict. Before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, low-grade conflict across the globe was prevalent, characterized by a high number of low-fatality conflicts scattered across thew orld's most violent regions. Rather than engage with their own forces, great powers like Russa would use external forces, the most known and effective of which was Wagner group, using them to pursue Russia's national political interests abroad. The war in Ukraine, and Russia's subsequent change in security posture, gives national security acedemcis and practitioners the opportunity to observe how a conventional war waged by a great power impacted its ability to continue to pursue its interests through irregular warfare waged by proxy forces abroad. It also presents an opportunity to evaluate the humanitarian impact of modern day conventional conflict in terms of loss of human life. In comparing these fatality numbers pre- and post-invasion, humanitarian and policy advocates can gain insight into the humanitarian impact of conventional conflict vs. enduring low-grade conflict involving various non-state actors. This could inform decisions on how to best concetrate deterrence efforts, against large scale combat operations or unconventional threats, to best prevent loss of life. 

**Possible Questions to Address**:
1. Has the world gotten more violent post-Russian invasion of Ukraine?
2. Are states, in fact, losing their monopoly on violence?
3. Are the nature of conflict interactions changing (i.e., who's fighting who?)
4. Which types of conflict are most lethal, and has that changed over time?
5. What's the source of the biggest loss of life, conventional war or low-grade conflict?
6. Did Russia's war in Ukraine hinder it's ability to conduct violence abroad in pursuit of its long-term state interests? This analysis would specifically use Wagner Group as a case study.

**Story Objective**: Tell the story of how Russia's invasion of Ukraine changed the security landscape in terms of scope and scale of violent attacks (in terms of fatalities) in Russia's existing sphere of military influence (to include Europe, Africa, and the Middle East). Explain what the implications this could hold for security communities seeking to curb conventional and unconventional violence in a modern context.
