### Part II: Project Summary

Part III of the final project built upon the progress made in part II, where I identfied my target audience and recieved feedback on what made my visualizations effective and what might make them better. To reiterate, the primary audience I selected for this story was stakeholders in the defense community to include practitioners, policymakers, and academics. However, I also wanted the information to be digestible to any interested voter concerned about issues pertaining to U.S. national security or global affairs. For this reason, I prioritized the feedback I recieved from the defense practitioner over that of my interview subjects who were less invested. Ultimately, I beleive the feedback made my graphs both more approachable to the more casual viewer as well as more clear to the seasoned defense enthusiast. The following is the story of how I came to my final product.

The most difficult part of assembling this narrative was the data cleaning process that took palce at the beginning of the project. After I identified my data source, I realized just how comprehensive and overwhelming it was to the average viewer. After doing some initial exploratory data analytics (EDA), I realized I needed to simplify the information I was presenting to make it interpretable and meaningful to my audience. I started by restricting my dataset down to a time period of interest. I chose August of 2021 to September of 2023 because that two year period provided an appropriate window of 6 months prior to the invasion and advanced an even two years up to present day. After creating that constraint, I further limited the events to violent conflicts, as the core of message was about costs in terms of lost human life, and the events with no fatalities (e.g., political protests) were not conducive to that message even if they were part of the data set. Then, I separated out all events tied to the key word "Russia" and grouped them together into a category called "Russian Forces," keeping Wagner Group as its own separate entity. This allowed me to severely limit the amount of groups I was refering to at any given moment, and that allowed me to cut down confusion in my visualizations. Finally, I added a regional constraint and only included data from Russia's primary theater of operations, which included Africa, Europe, and the Middle East. This allowed me to keep my map-based visualizations concentrated and less distracting. While, the data cleaning part of the project was time-intensive, it was worth it in the sense that I was confident at the end of the process that the story I was telling was true to the data and that I was not cherry-picking facts to advance my narrative.

The initial drafts of my visualization were largely the results of the EDA process, although more data manipulation was required to adapt the information to Flourish, which uses specific templates. After taking in my user feedback in Part II, I realized that I really didn't need to make too many changes to really improve my visualizations' interpretability, which was encouraging. I did notice that there was somewhat of a generational gap between my two "non-practitioner" interviewees. The older of the two was easily thrown off by horizontal axis labels or other minor labeling features that are more common today. The younger one found the visualizations much more intuitive. Because my target audience is more mature and maybe less familiar with data visualization techniques, I thought it was important to incorporate some of the changes from my older interviewee. For this reason, I adjusted some of the axis labels to be vertical instead of horizontal, made a point to get rid of any excess labeling that may be confusing completely, and reworked my titles to be more concise and impactful. These were all things my interviewees believed could improve the visualizations. I kept the color scheme, animation, and general graph structure as my audience appreciated those and thought they enhanced the subject matter. I did have one issue with the bar chart race graphic "Who's Fighting Who," which inexplicably stopped showing the chart associated with it. Even ater much trouble-shooting, I still couldn't fix it, but eventually recognized that it wasn't an essential part of the messaging and that the bar chart communicated the important information well on its own. 

I was attracted to Shorthand as a platform for this data story because it allowed me to easily incorporate quotes, pictures, and my visualizations in a way that flowed and was easy to understand. I picked dark colors because of the morbid topic - warfare. I used red as my primary color contrasted against black and gray to illustrate lost life and impart that more powerfully to my audience. I also leveraged publically avaiable photos of the war on Unsplash to further advance the theme. My intention for the overall structure was to be text heavy at the front to introduce the topic, and then to allow the data to speak for itself in support of that narrative through my visualizations. I think the combination was effective in communicating a point without getting too verbose. One of the most important things I learned in this process was the importance of good EDA in creating a data story. The work I put up front in cleaning and exploring the data helped me think of visualizations that might illustrate the data more clearly. It helped me put high quality products in front of my audience in part II, and that left me with much less to correct in part III. The end product, I belive, is just one telling narrative in a very rich dataset that speaks to a pertinent issue in today's violently complicated world.
