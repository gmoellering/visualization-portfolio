# Assignment: Critique by Design

### Assignment Overview

In this assignment, we are finding a visualization that could be improved and redesign it to make it more effective.

### Part I: Select a Visualization

For this assignment, I chose a visualization from a [Sports Illustrated article](https://www.si.com/college/2020/04/08/college-football-future-2020-ncaa-coronavirus) originally published in April 2020 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The article explored the far-reaching effects of a potential cancellation of the 2020 college football season on the world of college-athletics at large. The visualization itself attempted to show the extent to which Power 5 Conference athletic departments depend on their football programs to finance all other NCAA sports programs.

I was initially "attracted" to this visualization because it struck me as ugly and, therefore, immediately recommended itself for improvement. After taking time to inspect it further, I realized that the chart did actually have an interesting story to tell. It was surprising to see the extent to which football carried the other sports programs financially, especially in contrast to men's basketball, which I assumed would be more profitable than it was. The fact that I wasn't able to discover that interesting information until I took the time to really look at the chart indicated there was even more room for improvement. An ugly visualization that also contians useful information is a great candidate for redesign. 

### Part II: Critique the Visualization

Overall, I found that this data visualization contained useful information, but its lack of visual appeal, perceptibility, and engagement hindered it in delivering its message. I liked that the chart focused on the Power 5 Conferences and provided all the information needed to convey the main idea. I also think the intuitive chart format made it easy for the audience to gauge the difference between football as a profitable sport and all other sports. It was smart to group ‘all other sports’ together into one group rather than breaking them out into separate categories, as it allows the viewer to focus on football as the differentiating sport.

I thought this chart left a lot to be desired in terms of its perceptibility, aesthetic appeal, and engagement. It makes its point, but there are certainly aspects of the visualization that were easier to comprehend than others. The fact that the 0 on the x-axis is centered takes a moment to recognize when there are still lines on the far left and far right of the graph. The colors don’t convey anything beyond categorizing the bars and could be used better to advance the message. The bar chart is intuitive, but having three bars going two different directions makes it less clear how they compare to each other relationally. One of the text boxes in the graph could be more effectively used as a subtitle and the other one seems to repeat much of the same information already contained in the chart. If calling out the Big 10 conference advances the overall message, which it may not, doing so visually instead of using text would be a better approach. The small disclaimer in the bottom right hand corner about the source data not including private institution calls into question the truthfulness of the chart without much explanation as to how that should impact the audience’s interpretation. Finally, the visualization is not very engaging; there isn’t much about it that recommends itself to an audience or makes an effort to draw them in. 

I also thought this chart failed to leverage its content to fully engage its likely audience. The original article was a Sports Illustrated piece, so the audience was primarily sports fans/enthusiasts/analysts. I don’t think this visualization was terribly effective for reaching that audience because it resembles a chart you would find in an academic report more than a graphic you might see displayed on ESPN or featured on a network pregame show. Sports are part of the entertainment industry and, as such, audiences are accustomed to seeing aesthetically pleasing conference logos and the polished branding of university sports teams when they engage with that content. This visual doesn’t create the same amount of interest or provide those familiar visual elements that serve as immediate cues of the audience. Seeing a favorite conference or sports team logo can also evoke emotion in viewers, and this visualization misses some opportunities to leverage that emotion to create interest.

In terms of what I would do differently, I would start by making a more declarative title like “Football is the Life Support for all Other Power 5 Conference Sports” or similarly attention grabbing to draw the reader in. I would make the text box in the upper left a subtitle to the title and would delete the other callout box altogether. I would adjust the color scheme, not using red for men’s basketball (in terms of profit and loss, it’s intuitive to associate ‘green’ with profitable and ‘red’ with loss). I would consider using conference logos instead of text on the y-axis, which would be very familiar to a collegiate sports audience and would resonate more deeply. I would also make the labels on the x-axis more clear, maybe highlighting “PROFIT” and “LOSS” using green and red to emphasize the fact that one is taking away from the other. Finally, I would add a data citation to the graphic and include in the disclaimer the extent of the impact that excluding private schools has on the overall takeaway. If I had a lot of time available, I would experiment with different chart types to see if there’s a clearer way to make the comparison between football and other revenue losing sports. I would also experiment with the option of removing men’s basketball as it’s own separate bar and lumping it in with ‘all other sports.’ Although it’s nice to see the degree to which the only other profitable sport lags behind football, it still may not be essential to the message we want to convey.
