### Part II: User Research and Interviews

**Target Audeince and Interviewee Selection**: My target audience for this story is stakeholders in the defense community to include practitioners, policymakers, and academics. At the same time, I also understand that this information could be useful to any informed voter interested in issues pertaining to U.S. national security or global affairs. Therefore, my appraoch to finding interview subjects was to diversify. I selected one defense practitioner who has been following the Ukraine War and Wagner Group activity very closely over the past two years. I then selected one person I would consider an "interested voter" because they take an interest in current events pertaining to national security but are not deeply informed on defense budget issues or Russian military encroachments around the globe. My final subject was an artist who is not at all interested in national security issues. I thought in interviewing this person I could gauge the stand-alone effectiveness of my visualizations and maybe get valuable feedback on how to make them even more approachable or appealing.

The responses from my three interviews are summarized below.

**Adult - Early 30s - Defense Practitioner:**

***Can you tell me what the message for each of these visualizations is?***

*Counting Hidden Costs* - Russia had to consolidate its forces in Ukraine at the beginning of the invasion, and as the invasion hit stead-state attrition they attempted to resurrect their operations in Africa.

*A Tale of Two Wars* - Conflict in the rest of the world and for Wagner Group has stayed relatively consistent even through the Russian invasion.

*Who's Fighting Who?* - Big war causes more fatalities than other wars.

*Retreat to the Homefront* - Russia's invasion compelled them to do less with their irregular warfare elements abroad.

***What do you find effective or ineffective about each of these graphs?  Is there one that you like the best?***

*Counting Hidden Costs* - I like that the graph is interactive and that I can zoom in. I also like the time graph at the bottom and the fact that the bubbles show both the frequency of events involving those forces as well as the fallout in terms of total fatalities. I'm not sure what I would do with this graph though, it just kind of generally conveys information. I definitely find myself wanting to spend time with it though.

*A Tale of Two Wars* - This one is very visually appealing. I really like the red color scheme and that it's so clear and interactive. The line showing when the invasion occured is also helpful.

*Who's Fighting Who?* - The color scheme is great for this one because it draws your eyes to the important information, and I like the animation. I'm not sure if I like the fatality counter, I just don't know if it's really necessary. It might be cool to see information like the average fatalities per month instead of a cumulative count.

*Retreat to the Homefront* - I like this graph a lot because it shows something I think is really important - the rise and fall of Wagner Group activity in Africa. I like that you grouped them by continent though to make it clear. I also like that the colors are consistent with the other graphs. This one might be my favorite graph because I like the information so much. The Tale of Two Wars is probably my second favorite.

***Is there anything that you found confusing or surprising?***

*Counting Hidden Costs* - It's not clear from the current color scheme which events are Russian Forces and which ones are Wagner Group. I was a little surprised to see that the Russians are still active in Syria.

*A Tale of Two Wars* - No, I thought this one was clear and consistent with what I know.

*Who's Fighting Who?* - No, this one was also clear and consistent with what I know.

*Retreat to the Homefront* - I liked this one, but I was surprised to see just how much operations picked back up in Africa towards the end of 2022.

***Is there anything you would change or do differently?***

In addition to some of the critiques mentioned above, I would consider adding information about Wagner Group's coups against the Russian military this past summer. It would be interesting to see how their military activity changed before and after that event. I would also consider making that pop-up information about the Ukraine invasion on the "Who's Fighting Who?" graph bigger.

**Adult - Early 60s - Interested Voter:**

***Can you tell me what the message for each of these visualizations is?***

*Counting Hidden Costs* - It took me a few minutes to figure out where in the world we were oriented to, but essentially this is the rate at which the conflict in Ukraine accelerated and how many people died. 

*A Tale of Two Wars* - There was a lot of conflict around the whole world in August 2023.

*Who's Fighting Who?* - External forces or invaders must have had a big part to play in the rise in fatalities. 

*Retreat to the Homefront* - I don't know that I really understand what this is telling me. 

***What do you find effective or ineffective about each of these graphs?  Is there one that you like the best?***

*Counting Hidden Costs* - Colors indicating blood/loss of life were very effective, but I would get rid of the 'other' on top of the fatality count as it's confusing. I'd also think it would be better to focus on the total fatalities in stead of the rate. Labeling the regions would be helpful.

*A Tale of Two Wars* - I didn't understand that those numbers on the bottom were dates, so if you could reformat them that would be helpful. Also make the line demarkatign the Russian invasion more clear because I didn't notice it at first. I do like the color scheme.

*Who's Fighting Who?* - This graph was very effective, but I would slow down the animation to make it more digestible. Also the popup about the ivasion was great but should be bigger. Similar to the last graph, changing the dates would be helpful.

*Retreat to the Homefront* - I do not understand the y-axis labels when they are horizontal and at the top. It threw off the whole graph for me. Also going from graphs involving fatalities to ones involving events threw me off.

***Is there anything that you found confusing or surprising?***

*Counting Hidden Costs* - I was confused because I didn't feel well-oriented to the geography on the map. I wasn't sure where we were.

*A Tale of Two Wars* - Again, I would prefer if the 'Russian Invasion' label was vertical instead of horizontal. I thought initially that it was referring to everything to the left of the line as the Russian Invasion instead of the line itself.

*Who's Fighting Who?* - I didn't understand that this encompassed all conflicts from Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. Maybe clean up the language to reflect that.

*Retreat to the Homefront* - Same comments as some of the earlier visualizations.

***Is there anything you would change or do differently?***

Nothing outside what I mentioned in previous sections.

**Female - Artist:**

***Can you tell me what the message for each of these visualizations is?***

*Counting Hidden Costs* - This is where Russia's battles occured, when they occured, and the extent of their impact. I found this easy to understand at the outset. 

*A Tale of Two Wars* - The rest of the world has a lot of conflict and the Russians experienced almost no fatalities before the invasion and a lot after the invasion. 

*Who's Fighting Who?* - The war in Ukraine caused a huge skyrocket in fatalities.

*Retreat to the Homefront* - Wagner Group activity was concentrated in Africa before the invasion and then they moved to Europe before coming back to Africa again.

***What do you find effective or ineffective about each of these graphs?  Is there one that you like the best?***

*Counting Hidden Costs* - I like the fact that it's on a map and it's very visual in that you just have to watch the animation to get it. I also like the trend line that goes with the timeline at the bottom and that the dots show location and fatalities.

*A Tale of Two Wars* - I didn't notice that the fatality legend was even there. The 'Foreces Engaged in Conflict' y-axis label was distracting from the main point.

*Who's Fighting Who?* - It shows the movement, so I like the animation, and I like how the color makes the important bar stand out. I didn't like how the pop-up of the invasion wasn't obvious.

*Retreat to the Homefront* - I like the color scheme, how it's consistent with everything else. I also like the line showing the Russian invasion. I thought this one was pretty clear.

***Is there anything that you found confusing or surprising?***

*Counting Hidden Costs* - Nope I really like this one.

*A Tale of Two Wars* - I didn't understand the fatality aspect of the heatmap so that was confusing.

*Who's Fighting Who?* - The extent to which the war in Ukraine changed the bar was surprising, but nothing was confusing.

*Retreat to the Homefront* - I wasn't surprised or confused by anything here.

***Is there anything you would change or do differently?***

*Counting Hidden Costs* - It is a little difficult to tell the geography given the light background and borders.

*A Tale of Two Wars* - Nothing different from what was already mentioned previously

*Who's Fighting Who?* - I would just make that popup about the invasion occuring stand out more.

*Retreat to the Homefront* - I might get rid of that y-axis label altogether and make it part of the subtitle.

**Takeaways From Feedback:**

I did get some interesting feedback that I found helpful in determining the most important components that should be included in the final visualizations. The following were some of the primary takeaways:

1. Labeling - I noticed across my feedback, but especially for my audience that was less familiar with the subject matter, that some of my choices on where I placed my labels made my graphs more confusing. In some cases, my labling needs to be more targeted, descriptive and specific, and in other cases I need to re-orient their position on the graph or maybe just get rid of them altogether to cut down on confusion.
2. Animation and Color Scheme Worked Well - I got universally good feedback about the animation I used in my graphs. I was initially worried that they the animation would be over-the-top or detract from the overall message, but my interviewees really seemed to appreciate them. The interviewee's also thought the color-scheme was helpufl and worked well with the theme of conflict/war.
3. Subtitles and Text Content - I was surprised to find that, for my audience who were not defense practitioners, that when a graph confused them reading the subtitles and text descriptions didn't seem to help them get the message any faster. I need to change those to make sure that they are advancing my message in a clear and concise way or remove them altogether.

Overall, I was pleased with how much of the content my non-technical audience was able to absorb initially. Though, it was surprising for me to see how something as small as the placement of an axis label could throw off my audience to the extent that they couldn't absorb the message anymore. In these instances, when I would clarify something small about the legend or what a label meant, it would lead to an "aha" moment where they suddenly got it. It is encouraging to know that small changes like this can go a long way in making my graphs more approachable. I was also pleased that my defense practitioner was easily able to interpret all the graphs and actually ended up spending more time with them trying to extract other pieces of information. This tells me that the visuals themsmelves are substantive and interesting.
