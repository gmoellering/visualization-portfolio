# Assignment: Final Project Part II

### Assignment Overview

In this assignment, we are developing the story outline and relevant visual compondents of our final data visualization project.

### Part II: User Research and Interviews

**Target Audeince and Interviewee Selection**: My target audience for this story is stakeholders in the defense community to include practitioners, policymakers, and academics. At the same time, I also understand that this information could be useful to any informed voter interested in issues pertaining to U.S. national security or global affairs. Therefore, my appraoch to finding interview subjects was to diversify. I selected one defense practitioner who has been following the Ukraine War and Wagner Group activity very closely over the past two years. I then selected one person I would consider an "interested voter" because they take an interest in current events pertaining to national security but are not deeply informed on defense budget issues or Russian military encroachments around the globe. My final subject was an artist who is not at all interested in national security issues. I thought in interviewing this person I could gauge the stand-alone effectiveness of my visualizations and maybe get valuable feedback on how to make them even more approachable or appealing.

The responses from my three interviews are summarized below.

**Adult - Early 30s - Defense Practitioner:**

***Can you tell me what the message for each of these visualizations is?***

*Counting Hidden Costs* - Russia had to consolidate its forces in Ukraine at the beginning of the invasion, and as the invasion hit stead-state attrition they attempted to resurrect their operations in Africa.

*A Tale of Two Wars* - Conflict in the rest of thew orld and for Wagner Group has stayed relatively consistent even through the Russian invasion.

*Who's Fighting Who?* - Big war causes more fatalities than other wars

*Retreat to the Homefront* - Russia's invasion compelled them to do less with their irregular warfare elements abroad.

***What do you find effective or ineffective about each of these graphs?  Is there one that you like the best?***

*Counting Hidden Costs* - I like that the graph is interactive and that I can zoom in. I also like the time graph at the bottom and the fact that the bubbles show both the frequency of events involving those forces as well as the fallout in terms of total fatalities. I'm not sure what I would do with this graph though, it just kind of generally conveys information. I definitely find myself wanting to spend time with it though.

*A Tale of Two Wars* - This one is very visually appealing. I really like the red color scheme and that it's so clear and interactive. The line showing when the invasion occured is also helpful.

*Who's Fighting Who?* - The color scheme is great for this one because it draws your eyes to the important information, and I like the animation. I'm not sure if I like the fatality counter, I just don't know if it's really necessary. It might be cool to see information like the average fatalities per month instead of a cumulative count.

*Retreat to the Homefront* - I like this graph a lot because it shows something I think is really important - the rise and fall of Wagner Group activity in Africa. I like that you grouped them by continent though to make it clear. I also like that the colors are consistent with the other graphs. This one might be my favorite graph because I like the information so much. The Tale of Two Wars is probably my second favorite.

***Is there anything that you found confusing or surprising?***

*Counting Hidden Costs* - It's not clear from the current color scheme which events are Russian Forces and which ones are Wagner Group. I was a little surprised to see that the Russians are still active in Syria.

*A Tale of Two Wars* - No, I thought this one was clear and consistent with what I know.

*Who's Fighting Who?* - No, this one was also clear and consistent with what I know.

*Retreat to the Homefront* - I liked this one, but I was surprised to see just how much operations picked back up in Africa towards the end of 2022.

***Is there anything you would change or do differently?***

In addition to some of the critiques mentioned above, I would consider adding information about Wagner Group's coups against the Russian military this past summer. It would be interesting to see how their military activity changed before and after that event. I would also consider making that pop-up information about the Ukraine invasion on the "Who's Fighting Who?" graph bigger.

**Adult - Early 60s - Interested Voter:**

***Can you tell me what the message for each of these visualizations is?***

*Counting Hidden Costs* - 

*A Tale of Two Wars* - 

*Who's Fighting Who?* - 

*Retreat to the Homefront* -

*Counting Hidden Costs* -

*Who's Fighting Who?* - 

*Retreat to the Homefront* - 

***Is there anything that you found confusing or surprising?***

*Counting Hidden Costs* -

*Who's Fighting Who?* - 

*Retreat to the Homefront* -

**Takeaways From Feedback:**

I did get some interesting feedback that I found helpful in determining the most important components that should be included in the final visualization. The following were some of the primary takeaways:

1. The Men’s Basketball statistic is important to viewers - they think that it drives home how dramatic the profits from football are. 
2. Having the conference logos in the graphic and ordering the conferences themselves made the message resonate much more strongly.
3. The stacked area chart was rated the best one by both people I talked to, which was interesting because one almost preferred the tornado chart and the other almost preferred the waterfall chart, which are very different visualizations. 
    
 The fact that two people who were initially drawn to initial first visualizations were able to settle on the third one as the best and most interpretable helps me establish that the stacked area chart may appeal to the widest audience. I also got a lot of positive feedback about the aesthetic appeal of the color scheme, as green is reticent of both profits and football turf fields. I initially had questions as to whether or not including profits from Men’s Basketball was essential to advancing the message, but both people I interviewed seemed to think it was really important information once they saw it.
