### About Me 
My name is Genna Moellering, and I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Public Policy Management - Data Analytics from Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon University. 

Before coming to Heinz, I served as a Military Intelligence officer in the United States Army. It was in this profession that I began to appreciate the art that is effectively communicating complex information to the decision-makers who rely on it. 

In future professional roles, I hope to combine the data visualization skills I've cultivated through this program with my operational experience to continue to advance the public good. I'm passionate about using the incredible amounts of available data to inform policies and operations for altruistic organizations, making them as effective as possible.

### What I Hope to Learn
1. Gain exposure to a variety of ways to creatively and effectively visualize data
2. Become familiar with common errors that can detract from a visualization's effectiveness
3. How to develop a narrative that tells the story the data conveys
